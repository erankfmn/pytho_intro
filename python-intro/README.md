# Introduction to Python for Data Science

This is the Pycon 2018 tutorial Introduction to Python for Data Science.

## Outcomes

Attendees will come away with knowledge about how to effectively use Python and packages in the PyData stack like pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn to do data science. We'll learn how to get and read data, clean and munge data, conduct exploratory data analysis, and use scikit-learn to do machine learning with a real-world data set. We will focus on best practices in using Python along the way.
